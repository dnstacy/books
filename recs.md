# Book Recommendations

### Fantasy:
* *Mistborn* by Brandon Sanderson - the world centuries after the bad guy won, magic system 
tied to metals (very cool), and there’s kind of a heist. It’s sick.
* *The Way of Kings* by Brandon Sanderson (*Stormlight Archives*) - expansive fantasy universe 
that I refuse to even try to summarize here. If you like multi-pov and epic world building, 
go ahead and read this. I know it’s a chonky guy, but it’s good. The first one is a bit slow, 
but the payoff is huge. The second one is an all time favorite.
* *Elantris* by Brandon Sanderson - there is no way to make this snappy. It’s Brandon 
Sanderson’s first book, and if you like the others, you’ll probably like this one. Personally, I 
enjoyed this one better than at least the first *Mistborn*.
* *Tress of the Emerald Sea* by Brandon Sanderson - described as *The Princess Bride* if it were 
from Buttercup’s POV. This describes the vibes quite well. We have young Tress who does not 
want to leave her island until her love is stolen away. Then she journeys out onto the sea of 
spores (very dangerous) and has adventures and makes friends. Just lovely.
* *Yumi and the Nightmare Painter* by Brandon Sanderson - *Your Name* vibes as there is 
mysterious body swapping between the loner Painter and a rule-abiding Yumi.
* *Assassin’s Apprentice* by Robin Hobb - illegitimate son of the former king in waiting (RIP 
that guy) is claimed by the royal family and is tasked with training to be the royal 
assassin. It’s slow paced as we follow the main character through a lot of his childhood, but 
it’s a really awesome payoff (the whole trilogy).
* *Ship of Magic* by Robin Hobb - beginning of the next trilogy after the *Assassin’s Apprentice* 
trilogy. It is highly recommended, though not necessary, to read this trilogy after the first. 
Multi-pov fantasy with sentient ships, ambitious pirates, and a family torn apart by their 
ancestors’ choices as well as their own diverse desires. 
* *The Fifth Season* by N.K. Jemison - the world periodically experiences apocalyptic events as
Earth rebels against the humans who have destroyed it. Additionally, we have some people who 
have super powers that are basically earth-bending abilities, but the people are very 
dangerous as they require sapping energy from the environment and people around them to 
support their powers. As such, they typically have two different options for living: 
government-sanctioned work or hiding in society. Those who perform the government-sanctioned 
work are protected but ostracized from the rest of society, but if they choose to enter 
society on their own, they could be killed by others if it is revealed who they really are.
* *A Sorceress Comes to Call* by T. Kingfisher - fairy tale vibes. Cordelia is under the thumb 
of her evil sorceress mother and is forced to watch as her mother upends the lives of those 
around her until she finally decides she’s had enough when her mother attempts to marry a 
wealthy but kind and unsuspecting man.
* *Uprooted* by Naomi Novik - fairy tale vibes. Every ten years, the village’s local wizard (the 
Dragon) selects a 17 year old girl to stay with him in his tower for the next ten years as 
payment for protection against the evil woods. Despite being born during this year’s cohort of 
17 year old girls, Agnieszka does not fear being chosen because everyone knows that her best 
friend Kasia will be chosen since Kasia is by far the most remarkable girl in the village. 
Once the time for the selection comes, however, Kasia is not chosen to everyone’s shock. It’s 
just a great story about female friendship and not accepting the status quo.
* *A Deadly Education* by Naomi Novik - loner main character attends a magic school that is 
actively trying to kill its students while also grappling with her destiny to be an evil 
sorceress despite not wanting to be bad; she learns to make friends, which might very well be 
necessary to survive school.
* *The Green Mile* by Stephen King - if you like the movie, I think you're gonna like the book. 
If you've never watched the movie and don't know what it's about, it's about a prison guard 
who works in the death row section of a prison and a convicted murderer with supernatural 
healing abilities who seems innocent.
* *The Princess Bride* by William Goldman - it's very similar to the movie but in book form!
* *Before the Coffee Gets Cold* by Toshikazu Kawaguchi - more magical realism than fantasy, but 
here it is. Translated Japanese fiction about a coffee shop that has a table where you can 
travel back in time but only for as long as your coffee is warm. It’s quite cozy and takes 
you through the time travels of four different people and how their experience changed their 
lives.
* *Legendborn* by Tracy Deonn - YA fantasy with a magic system around Arthurian legend, takes 
place at UNC Chapel Hill (shout out), and deals with heavy topics like grief and racism while 
still being a romp of a story.

### Sci-Fi:
* *Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy* by Douglas Adams - the prototypical silly and weird sci-fi 
comedy. It’s a classic and explores some very silly ideas.
* *Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency* by Douglas Adams - I’m not super sure where this 
falls genre-wise, but it’s typically shelved with sci-fi so here we are. It’s a funny, silly 
time; great for enjoyers of *Hitchhiker’s Guide*. Despite the title, you will not find a 
tantalizing mystery here. 
* *An Absolutely Remarkable Thing* by Hank Green - all across the world, a strange robot appears 
in major cities for reasons no one knows. April May achieves overnight fame by posting a silly 
video of herself interacting with the robot that she calls Carl. The rest is a mixture of 
uncovering who Carl is and why he’s arrived as well as April May grappling with her new 
celebrity status.
* *A Psalm for the Wild-Built* by Becky Chambers - one day robots achieve sentience and decide 
they no longer want to work for humans and instead just want to live in the woods in peace. 
Generations pass and now humans live without advanced technology and have achieved somewhat of a 
utopia. Our main character, Dex, still feels unfulfilled with their lot in life. One day Dex 
meets Mosscap, the first robot to be seen by a human in centuries. Mosscap has a simple 
question, “What do people need?”
* *The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet* by Becky Chambers - found family vibes as a young woman 
boards a spaceship to escape her past and forge her own adventure. We have a diverse crew and 
many places to travel across the galaxy.
* *All Systems Red* by Martha Wells - Murderbot has overridden its control module to give itself 
free will. The trouble with this is all it wants to do is watch its favorite TV shows. (Yes, 
Murderbot uses it pronouns).
* *Project Hail Mary* by Andy Weir - a man wakes up in space alone; he has no idea how he got 
there. Read along to find out why and how he ended up where he is and how he’s gonna work to get 
out of his predicament. 
* *A Memory Called Empire* by Arkady Martine - I’m gonna recommend this to the girlies who like 
Gideon the Ninth. I don’t have a great reason for this, but they feel similar to me despite 
being quite different in tone and story. This one is about a girl who travels from her home 
station to the heart of an intergalactic empire as an ambassador after her predecessor 
mysteriously died. The twist is she has a little memory chip with a shadow of her previous 
predecessor’s consciousness and memories to assist her in her job, but it’s severely out of date 
and suddenly goes haywire.
* *The Hunger Games* by Suzanne Collins - if you haven’t read this book yet, then you’re missing 
out on a classic dystopian. It’s way more than a love triangle and a chosen one trope, and the 
deeply stratified and oppressive society is more similar to our own than is comfortable.
* *Parable of the Sower* by Octavia E. Butler - dystopian that was written in the 90s and starts 
in 2024 and takes place across several years. Climate change is wreaking havoc and society is 
incredibly stratified and violent. Our main protagonist suffers from hyperempathy, causing her 
to feel the prevalent pain of others around her. To persevere in the challenging world she lives 
in, she develops her own worldview/religion called Earthseed. The core tenant being: God is 
Change.

### Contemporary Romance:
* *To All the Boys I've Loved Before* by Jenny Han - YA fake dating with very charming main 
characters. If you read *The Summer I Turned Pretty* and didn't like it, don't worry! This one is 
way better!
* *The Flatshare* by Beth O’Leary - girl MC just broke up with her abusive bf and needs somewhere 
new to live; boy MC needs extra money and is willing to rent out his apartment during the night 
while he works; cue communication by sticky notes and very cute, fun times.
* *Get a Life, Chloe Brown* by Talia Hibbert - this is the first book in a trilogy about the Brown 
sisters. They do not necessarily need to be read in any order, but I’m just listing this one 
because it was the first published, and I really like them all. Chloe Brown deals with chronic 
pain and feels unfulfilled by her very safe life that she’s created for herself. She decides to 
create a bucket list to spice her life up that includes camping, riding on a motorcycle, and 
meaningless but enjoyable sex. Enter Red Morgan, her apartment’s new handyman. Despite having a 
rocky start to their relationship, Red decides to help her with her bucket list. I just think 
this author is very funny, and I enjoy her stories. This one has a couple of spicy scenes.
* *Seven Days in June* by Tia Williams - not a rom-com. This one is about two writers who spent 
seven tumultuous days together when they were teenagers before being dramatically separated and 
never seeing one another until many years later when they both happen to be at the same writing 
convention. Will they pick right back where they left off or did things end too tragically and 
change too dramatically between them? Deals with heavy topics like chronic pain, drug/alcohol 
abuse, juvenile delinquency, and self harm. Also has some spicy scenes.
* *Just for the Summer* by Abby Jimenez - technically the third book in this series, but it’s my 
favorite and the other books are not necessary to read even though they’re good. Justin makes a 
post on Reddit after his best friend breaks their lease to move in with his current girlfriend 
(Justin’s ex) to inquire if he is the asshole for naming his ugly rescue dog after this best 
friend. In the course of this post, Justin reveals that he has a curse where after he breaks up 
with a girl, she goes on to date her soulmate. Emma sees this post and slides into Justin’s DMs 
because she has the same curse. The two decide perhaps they should date as a way to break their 
respective curses and find their happily ever afters. Good shit.
> *Part of Your World* and *Yours Truly* are the previous two books in this series. I like *Part of 
Your World* mostly because it is a competently written romance with characters who have a good 
amount of chemistry. Otherwise, it isn’t the most exciting or interesting, but it will scratch 
an itch. *Yours Truly* might be my favorite if it weren’t for its use of one of my very least 
favorite tropes of all time in the third act. It has excellent representation of anxiety and 
uses communication by letters as a method for moving the plot forward. That’s good shit.

### Romantasy:
* *The Very Secret Society of Irregular Witches* by Sangu Mandanna - a witch goes to be a 
tutor/nanny for three young witches on a country estate in England with a grumpy but lovable 
librarian. It's cute but also has some depth as it deals with feelings of isolation and 
loneliness.
* *The Wisteria Society* of Lady Scoundrels by India Holton - pirates and witches in Victorian 
England with flying houses. It’s just a funny and silly time.
* *Emily Wilde’s Encyclopaedia of Faeries* by Heather Fawcett - bookish introverted college 
professor studies faeries and she’s pretty sure her annoying coworker is one.

### Memoirs:
* *Know My Name* by Chanel Miller - really the memoir to end all memoirs. Chanel Miller is a 
survivor of sexual assault on Stanford’s campus who ended up with a high profile court case 
due to her attacker being a young swimmer for Stanford. Just a powerful narrative about 
surviving sexual assault and journeying through the judicial system. If you only take one 
* *Becoming* by Michelle Obama - just a solid memoir written by a very cool lady.
* *Born a Crime* by Trevor Noah - details growing up in South Africa during Apartheid as a mixed 
race kid, funny and devastating
* *I'm Glad My Mom Died* by Jennette McCurdy - details growing up as a child actor with an 
abusive mother. Did you watch iCarly? Read this.
* *Finding Me* by Viola Davis - I’ve read a few celebrity memoirs, and this is a standout for 
sure. Excellent audiobook.
* *We Were Dreamers* by Simu Liu - another standout celebrity memoir. Simu had an incredibly 
troubling childhood and his resilience and charm really shine through here.
recommendation from me, let it be this.
* *The Anthropocene Reviewed* by John Green - this isn’t really a memoir but rather an essay 
collection. Either way, it’s fantastic. The premise is John Green just rating a bunch of 
different things on a five point scale and taking you through his thought process of why the 
thing should be that rating.
* *Everything is Tuberculosis* by John Green - again, maybe it’s weird to call this a memoir 
because it is a rundown on one of the deadliest diseases in history, but it is so personally 
explored that I can’t really call it anything else. John Green is an expert storyteller, and 
he’s at his best when he is exploring topics he is passionate about like this.
* *Just Mercy* by Bryan Stevenson - memoir about a lawyer who works with convicted murderers on 
death row. He works on commuting the sentences of these inmates in addition to seeking re-trials
for those he believes wrongly convicted. It’s a huge indictment of our justice system but also a 
refreshing look at the capacity for good that lives within people.
* *Legacy* by Uché Blackstock, MD - a doctor takes you through her journey of becoming a medical 
doctor as a black woman in the footsteps of her mother who died tragically young. Excellent 
exploration and critique of our medical system and education.
* *What My Bones Know* by Stephanie Foo - memoir about living with complex PTSD after suffering an 
abusive childhood. As harrowing as what Stephanie lived through, she weaves an inspiring and 
hopeful story. The really amazing thing about this book is that it has excerpts from her therapy 
sessions that just really explore her inner thoughts and feelings as well as how her therapist 
responds to them (not always as kindly as you would think). Highly, highly, highly recommend the 
audiobook.
